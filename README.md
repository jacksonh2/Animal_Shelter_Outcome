# Animal_Shelter_Outcome

The data comes from Austin Animal Shelter, and I downloaded the csv files from a ![Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes).
The dataset features cats and dogs that are taken in by the Animal Shelter, their breed, color, age and etc., and the eventual outcome of these animals.
This analysis focuses on finding out what feature/attribute contributes the most to a good outcome(adoption, return to owner) for these sheltered animals.
